The preprocessing of data as per the requirements completed successfully with the desired results.
The neural network model is created using the tensorflow and keras to assign them to the input layers in the required samples. 
The structure of the model is updated with data compiling and test data is used to successfully generate and export the HDF5 file. 
Optimization of the model with the desired accuracy of more than 75% obtained as per the requirements providing the expected results by utilizing the data and crating the HDF5 file.
